# Assignment1

Compile: run the command "make"

Clean: run the command "clean"

Problems Encountered: Mostly the problems I encountered were not knowing enough about C and system calls, I learned ALOT during this project and it was very enjoyable. I resubmitted passed the deadline because in one of your lectures I remember you saying as long as it's in before 6am/7am when you start grading then its fine.
